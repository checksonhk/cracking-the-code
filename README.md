# Cracking The Coding Interview
My solutions to the problems in 'Cracking the Coding Interview' by Gayle Lackmann McDowell. 

These are the chapters, I have gone through and provided solutions for :
 - Chapter 01 Arrays-and-Strings
 - Chapter 02 Linked-Lists
 - Chapter 03 Stacks-and-Queues
 - Chapter 04 Trees-and-Graphs
 - Chapter 07 Object-Oriented-Design
 - Chapter 08 Recursion-and-Dynamic-programming
 - Chapter 10 Sorting-and-searching
 
 keep in mind, these are simply the best solutions I could up with at the time, and are not necessarily the most optimal solutions

 TODO:
 - Chapter  05 Bit-manipulation
 - Chapter  06 Math-and-logic-puzzles
 - Chapter  16 Moderate
 - Chapter  17 Hard
